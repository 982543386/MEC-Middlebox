|  MEC Middlebox Solution
----------------------

We propose a middlebox approach for the MEC platform deployment in 4G LTE networks.
It is standard-compliant and transparent to existing cellular network components, so 
they need not be modified. The platform sits on the S1 interface, which connects an LTE base 
station to its core network, and does traffic filtering, manipulation and forwarding.
Such middlebox approach has low deployment cost and is easy to install. 
We have confirmed its viability on both OAI-based and commercial LTE platforms.
Please give it a try!!

  Getting Started
  _____________________
  
  This release demonstrates how to set up the MEC-middlebox platform and run it 
  with a release version of the OAI platform comprising both radio access network (RAN)
  and evolved packet core (EPC).


## Step 1: Download and install OAI RAN and EPC

   Download OAI source and installation guide here.
   
   [OAI Guide From Official](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/AutoBuild)
  
   
	Note:
	We use the following development branches for EPC and RAN.
  - EPC: SHA = 724542d0b59797b010af8c5df15af7f669c1e838
  - RAN: SHA = 67df8e0e7b46200b2ee43a2705def3340ddfd719



## Step 2: Download and install MEC-middlebox
   
   Download MEC-middlebox source here.
