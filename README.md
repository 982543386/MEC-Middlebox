# Getting Started






This guide shows how to run Mobile Edge Computing platform, our middlebox approach  with open source software OpenAirInterface as the LTE protocol stack implementation

## Step 1: Download and build OAI on your machine

```

```



  - EPC: We use the develop branch: SHA = 724542d0b59797b010af8c5df15af7f669c1e838

  - RAN: We use the develop branch: SHA = 67df8e0e7b46200b2ee43a2705def3340ddfd719









## Step 2: Get our module on OAI MEC-Middle branch

## Overall architecture

 - We place the MEC platform between RAN and EPC and use a cable to connect to each component.

 - The architecture is as figure below
